open-cgf is only tested under linux. It might work under Windows, but it is unlikely to do so without changes.
If you'd like Windows support, please raise an issue at http://code.google.com/p/open-cgf/issues/list
Solaris support is probable, but again untested.

Steps to install.
0. Install Erlang, using packages from http://www.erlang.org or your distribution's package manager.
1. Untar or use subversion to get latest software.
2. Type 'make debug' in the ./src directory
3. Copy the example configuration files e.g. cp ./etc/open-cgf.config.original ./etc/open-cgf.config
4. Edit the configuration file (./etc/open-cgf.config) to suit your local environment.
     Commented-out (%%) options have a default, so leave them commented out until you have the system running...

You are now ready to run open-cgf.
a. In ./bin type ./open-cgf -i
b. If it starts up successfully you will see many messages, and it will leave you at the Erlang shell prompt 1>
c. Enable your GGSN/SGSN/ITP and monitor the messages, CDRs will be automatically written.

Recompiling without debug on will reduce the noise level significantly, but open-cgf is still undergoing integration and the more debug the better.
Please send any fault, bug, enhancements to feedback@3gtelcotools.com -- I'd love to hear from you.

Cheers,
Bruce
